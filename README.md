# AI_chatbot
Abhishek's Dynamic Chatbot was a versatile tool that users could customize for any field by answering three questions: how it should behave, its specialization, and preferred tone. Accessing chat history was simple with the command `npm run console`, requiring users to log in with their username. Exiting the chatbot window was as easy as typing `/quit`, and to leave the chat history, users could use Ctrl+C. The chatbot focused solely on questions within its designated field of expertise. Additionally, there was a customer care chatbot available to guide users on how Abhishek's Dynamic Chatbot operated, answering questions exclusively related to its functionalities.

Running `npm start` initiated the build and execution of the chatbot.

Executing `npm run console` provided access to the chat history.
